Meatballs.js
==========

According to the Fermi paradox, we can reasonably conclude that somewhere in the
galaxy there exists a solar system in which lumpy meatlike planets orbit a
meat-pumpkin. Scientists using the WebGL-based JavaScript library Three.js have
recently produced a fairly accurate rendition of this solar system
for your viewing pleasure. Thanks to Andre Brown for the 3d models.
